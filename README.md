# blender_ninjarip
I have not found a ninjaripper for Blender 2.8x to fit my needs so I wrote my own.<br>
Use the zip file to quickly install the add-on to Blender.


This is a very simple addon written in a couple of hours.<br>
It has support for:
<ul>
<li>Vertex XYZ:    Position
<li>Vertex UV:     Texture Coordinate
<li>Vertex RGBA:   Color
<li>Vertex NxNyNz: Normal
 </ul>
 <br>
 It does not support automatic linking of textures. (I just didn't need this yet)
